[Antity](http://digitalantfarm.github.io/Antity/) is a digital art project by [Japh](https://twitter.com/Japh).

It's an exploration in the simulated organic movement of simple digital entities with basic artificial intelligence and neutral networks.

In its current infant form, everything is based on randomness and probability. AI is yet to be developed.
